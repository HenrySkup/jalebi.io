In our current age of computer based design and fabrication this process is dominated by CAD and CAM; each environment requires, at least, one unique base file formats, with several other supporting files.  This layering can cause much confusion as files, user environments, settings, etc all change at alarmingly high rates.  Additionally, these tools (CAD and CAM) are large, faceless programs very difficult to learn *and* master, and often heavily dictate one design style or methodology.\r\n\r\nNow is a time to break this paradigm or old.  We want to simplify this design procss by throwing away the unnecessary and getting out of each user's way, while giving more control to the end user to customize their own experience.\r\n\r\n####User Workflows\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Current Work Flow*            *Eventual Workflow*\r\n\r\nPreDigitalWork                    PreDigitalWork\r\n    ||                                  ||\r\n[via work/HCI]                          ||\r\n    ||                            [via work/HCI]\r\n    \\/                                  ||\r\n   CAD                                  ||\r\n    ||                                  \\/\r\n[.stl, .3dm, etc.]                Browser CAD/CAM\r\n    ||                                  ||\r\n    \\/                                  ||\r\n   CAM                                  ||\r\n    ||                            [motor controle]\r\n[.gCode, .nc]                           ||\r\n    ||                                  ||\r\n    \\/                                  \\/\r\nMachine                            Machine/moters\r\n(internal driver logic)\r\n```\r\n####The Web Browser\r\n\r\nThink of the application that is on nearly every device, every OS, and is used by just about every computer user.  This would be the web browser.  (And, increasingly within this category, this has been the Google Chrome browser.)  The web browser is an app accessible to anyone and everyone -- it has ease-of-use, it is free, it ise used to communicate, socialize, shop, learn, etc. -- it is familiar.  This is the key.  For a tool to be used (and loved) it has to be familiar, and there is no other app so familiar to so many different people.\r\n\r\nOn top of this human-centirc consideration, as browsers have developed and web standards have solidified, they have become technologically advanced applications that can now do so much more than render text in semi-predicable ways.  Now they can compute things themselves, communicate with lots of different sources -- both local and non-local.  Browsers have legions of developers all around the world not only because of the economic incentives that the skill offers but because web development is highly accessible and, as stated before, robust.\r\n\r\nAs websites have become web-apps, it has been noticed that the ability to continually (or at the very least highly regularly) communicate with central repositories is very advantageous.  Apps now only have to be downloaded and installed with two mouse clicks as opposed to the endless installs of the Sims which lasted *hours* and *hours* and required *so* many clearances and forms (and of course your parents we **never** there to do it). Also, web-apps are continually updated, they are never out-of-date (as long as they have a good team of developers and users behind them).  Adobe, Autodesk, and many other major software firms have noticed this fact and are currently transitioning to web-based (or web-enabled) platforms.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, we have decided to use the web-browser -- specifically, Google Chrome -- as the container for this project.  Because we have committed to a web-app, we then have also committed to ```JavaScript``` being the base language and logical framework.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n###Credits, et al.\r\n\r\nThis project is a group effort, of course, but its development is centered out of FabLab CEPT (Ahmedabad, GJ, India).
